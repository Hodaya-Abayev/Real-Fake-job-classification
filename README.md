# Real-Fake-job-classification
This project aims to identify fake job ads using machine learning techniques. The system is trained on a large database of real and fake job ads, and analyzes the text of the ads to distinguish between the two. The models that have been proven to be the most effective are KNN, Random forest and Decision tree.
